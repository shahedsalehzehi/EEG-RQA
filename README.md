Epileptic Seizure Detection Using Recurrence Plots and CNN

This project presents an automated method for detecting epileptic seizures from EEG signals recorded in animal models. The approach leverages recurrence plots to transform EEG time-series data into 2D visual representations, enabling effective feature extraction using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

Manual EEG interpretation is time-intensive and prone to subjective errors. This method automates the diagnostic process, improving both accuracy and efficiency in seizure detection tasks.
